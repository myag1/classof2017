<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a page made for my computer problem solving class. Basically we work on the computers doing and learning different things. Last semester we worked on making music and this semester we are working on websites. Learning how to create our own. My name is Mya Griffin and I run track for Norview High in Norfolk, VA. I am currently a senior Class of 2017 at Norview High. My class is the last class of the 90s so I wanted to include that on my website because the 90s was an amazing decade. The links on my page are websites that I shop at or just scroll thru when I have nothing to do.</p>
